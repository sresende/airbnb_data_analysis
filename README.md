# Prediction Models for Airbnb's Acommodations Price
Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Airbnb Dataset

## Problem Statement
The main purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict prices for accommodations there to be listed on the Airbnb website.  Here we consider two types of audience, the main one being Airbnb interested in providing the user with a price suggestion during the listing process based on its main features such as type of accommodation, number of rooms and neighborhood. The secondary stakeholders would be people who are interested in using the Airbnb service by making their properties available for rent on their website and having an idea of how much this service could earn from it.
