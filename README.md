# Prediction Models for Airbnb's Acommodations Price
Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Airbnb Dataset

## Problem Statement

Here we consider two types of audience, the main one being Airbnb interested in providing the user with a price suggestion during the listing process based on its main features such as type of accommodation, number of rooms and neighborhood.
